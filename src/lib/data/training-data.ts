export const TRAINING_DATA = `Hi! I'm John Carlo, a Computer Science student at Gordon College, Blue is my favorite color, and I have 2 dogs named Jake, and Finn. As someone passionate about technology, I've been fortunate enough to explore various aspects of software and web development while continuing to learn, especially in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP).

I've always been fascinated by how technology can solve real-world problems, and this curiosity led me to delve deeper into programming. Balancing my academic responsibilities with my personal interests in coding, I've grown from working on small-scale school projects to more ambitious initiatives, such as building a chatbot for user support.

Beyond my studies, I'm also passionate about digital art. I enjoy working on vector illustrations, animations, video editing, and creating artwork. These creative outlets allow me to express my artistic side and blend it with my technical skills.

When I'm not coding or creating digital art, I like to keep up with the latest trends in tech, spend time with family and friends, and dive into gaming or writing. I'm constantly learning and striving to sharpen my skills as I navigate the fast-evolving landscape of technology.

This portfolio is a reflection of my academic journey, passion for development, and the projects I've worked on so far. I'm excited to continue growing as a developer and contributing to innovative solutions that make a difference.

I'm a passionate developer with a keen interest in AI, web development, and data visualization. My work revolves around blending technology with innovative solutions, particularly in areas like UI/UX automation, web applications, and analytics. With experience in Vanilla PHP, Firebase, and Svelte, I enjoy crafting efficient and scalable applications that enhance user experience and functionality.

Currently, I'm working on a thesis project focused on Image-to-Code UI/UX Design Platform Using Pre-Trained AI Models. This project aims to assist developers—especially frontend developers and beginner coders—by automating UI/UX design into clean, structured code. My primary focus is ensuring the code quality, making it both usable and adaptable for real-world applications.

Beyond my thesis, I have also worked on various projects involving data visualization, particularly for Pokémon data analysis. I enjoy exploring statistical distributions and type-based insights, using data to create meaningful visual representations. In addition, I recently worked on a POS website execution plan for my CSE316 Project Management finals group quiz, demonstrating my ability to strategize and implement software solutions in a structured manner.

I thrive on learning and pushing boundaries in technology. Whether it's experimenting with new frameworks, optimizing databases, or finding ways to integrate AI into development workflows, I'm always eager to expand my skill set. My goal is to contribute to the developer community by building practical tools and solutions that simplify complex processes.

When I'm not coding, I'm likely researching new trends in AI-driven development, testing out new project ideas, or refining my understanding of software engineering best practices. I believe that technology should be both powerful and accessible, and I strive to create solutions that embody that philosophy.`;
